# Welcome

I'm Artez Chapman, a Network professional with 7+ experience.After years of troubleshooting connectivity issues, supporting emerging infrastructure, and diagnosing network operations, I'm expanding into cloud infrastructure and AI.

This blog documents what I'm building:
- Cloud platforms and automation (Azure, AWS)
- Container orchestration and virtualization
- AI integration and exploration
- Home lab projects and experiments

Just sharing my views on this ever changing landscape.
